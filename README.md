## Description

This projects implements the training of a 4-layer and a 5-layer neural network with 2023 flight and sales data from the datasets [`Filghts TEC_Valid.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4GvP8it_wwJsvtJekbBTY8qKGGOUV_s/view) and [`Sales TEC_Valid.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kf0UIkgDdlrkdKBU1IAUpJrYx-0KdK78/view) provided by Viva Aerobus. The 4-layer NN forecasts the occupancy of flights to estimate the number of passengers for flights scheduled for 2024 and part of 2025. The 5-layer NN uses the forecasted occupancy and predicts the number of products sold by category per flight for flights scheduled for 2024 and part of 2025.

This project was developed in Python using Pandas, TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
